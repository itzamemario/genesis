# Welcome to Genesis

This git workspace is where you'll find all code and documentation related to **Genesis** - *Everyones Synth*

## Vision

The chief ambition behind this project is to build a synth thats customisable under the hood and therefore functions more as an agent to facilate circuit design and experimentation. The *Synth* part of the project is merely to explore an auditory angle to circuit understanding and how the outputs of different signal chains *sound*, so to speak.
